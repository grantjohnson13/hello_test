# Hello World!
This "assignment" exists only to get you familiar with the submission
workflow. Write a hello world program; name your file \<WSUID\>\_hello.cpp.
Replace \<WSUID\> with your WSUID and do not write the `\<\>`.
The code is below. Compile and run the program on your own machine. When
you are satisfied, push your code to the repository and create a pull
request. You can then view the status of the GitHub Action to ensure it
was received correctly.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";

    return 0;
}
```
